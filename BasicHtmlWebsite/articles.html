                        <h3>Why I Started Coding</h3>
                        <p>
                            Ever since I was introduced to computers, I was fascinated by how websites and apps work.
                            In high school, I discovered HTML and built my first webpage. It had blinking text and a
                            blue
                            background ‚Äî it was terrible, but it sparked something in me.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Today, I‚Äôm learning web development seriously, and every day I feel like I‚Äôm building magic
                            with
                            code.

                        <h3>My First Hackathon</h3>
                        <p>
                            I participated in a 24-hour college hackathon with my friends. We were sleep-deprived, but
                            full of ideas.
                            Our project? An AI-based student buddy to help manage notes and reminders.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We didn‚Äôt win, but we learned more in 24 hours than in weeks of class. And that‚Äôs where my
                            love for
                            real-world
                            projects began.
